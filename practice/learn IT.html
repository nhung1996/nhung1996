        <p> this is a story about my life. I am an normal student at Danang University 
            of foreign language. In my school I not only went to school but also looked for a job
            .The first job I did is tutor, i thought that it is very simple job but not.Because I
             was not have good knowdledge about English grammar so when my student asked me
              some questions about a book I really did not have answers. This made me so ashamed, after 5month, I decided to quit this job
             and find another one. day by day Iam not concentrate on my work at school. My english is not good and not bad.
             ...
             one day I decided to learn IT. I think it is simple but it is very far from my imagine
             after the first day I really worry about shoud I go or not go. Very tire. I stayed up late 
             to think and finally I still learn IT
